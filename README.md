# PayPilot 💳

PayPilot is a full-stack payment links application that allows sellers to create shareable payment links and accept secure online payments through Stripe.

The project was created as a portfolio SaaS application to demonstrate modern frontend architecture, TypeScript, API integration, payment workflows, form handling, testing, and full-stack collaboration between a React frontend and Node.js backend.

## 🏗 Architecture

PayPilot separates frontend presentation, API communication, business logic, and persistence concerns.

```text
React + TypeScript
        │
        │ REST API
        ▼
Node.js + Express
        │
        ├──── Stripe API
        │
        ▼
Prisma ORM
        │
        ▼
Neon PostgreSQL
```

The frontend follows a feature-oriented structure to keep functionality modular and easy to extend.

└── utils/
```

## 💳 Payment Flow

A seller creates a payment link containing:

- Product name
- Description
- Amount
- Currency

PayPilot generates a unique slug that can be shared with a customer.

Example:

```text
/pay/my-product-link
```

When a customer visits the payment page:

1. The frontend requests the payment link using its slug.
2. The backend validates the payment link.
3. The backend creates a Stripe PaymentIntent.
4. Stripe returns a `clientSecret`.
5. The frontend renders Stripe Payment Element.
6. Stripe securely processes the payment.
7. The customer is redirected to the success state once payment is confirmed.

The Stripe secret key always remains on the server and is never exposed to the browser.

---

## 🔌 API

### Get public payment page

```http
GET /api/public/payment-links/:slug
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "paymentLink": {
    "id": "payment-link-id",
    "slug": "design-consultation",
    "productName": "Design Consultation",
    "description": "60 minute consultation",
    "amount": 120,
    "currency": "nzd",
    "sellerName": "PayPilot Seller"
  },
  "clientSecret": "pi_..."
}
```

---

### Create payment link

```http
POST /api/payment-links
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "productName": "Design Consultation",
  "description": "60 minute consultation",
  "amount": 120,
  "currency": "nzd"
}
```

---

### Stripe webhook

```http
POST /api/webhooks/stripe
```

Stripe webhooks are used to synchronise payment status with PayPilot after payment events occur.

---

## 🗄 Data Model

### User

Represents a PayPilot seller.

### PaymentLink

Stores information required to generate a public payment page.

```text
PaymentLink
├── id
├── slug
├── productName
├── description
├── amount
├── currency
├── status
├── clicks
└── userId
```

### Payment

Stores individual payment records.

```text
Payment
├── id
├── amount
├── currency
├── status
├── stripePaymentIntentId
├── paymentLinkId
├── userId
└── createdAt
```

Amounts are stored internally in the smallest currency unit and converted for display in the frontend.

---

## 🚦 Application States

Special attention is given to handling real-world asynchronous UI states.

The application includes:

- Loading states
- Empty states
- Validation errors
- API errors
- Payment processing
- Payment success
- Payment failure
- Expired payment links
- Missing payment links

For example:

```text
Payment Link
    │
    ├── Loading
    │
    ├── Available
    │      └── Payment processing
    │             ├── Success
    │             └── Failure
    │
    ├── Expired
    │
    └── Not Found
```

---

## ♿ Accessibility

Accessibility is considered throughout the application.

Examples include:

- Semantic HTML
- Proper form labels
- Keyboard-accessible interactions
- Accessible error messages
- React Testing Library queries based on roles and labels
- Clear loading and payment feedback

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Frontend tests focus primarily on user behaviour rather than implementation details.

Examples include testing:

- Form validation
- Payment link creation
- Loading states
- API failures
- User interactions
- Accessible form controls
- Success and error flows

Example:

```tsx
expect(
  screen.getByRole("button", {
    name: /create payment link/i,
  }),
).toBeInTheDocument();
```

---

## 🔐 Security

PayPilot follows several important payment security principles:

- Stripe secret keys are stored only on the backend
- Payment details are handled directly by Stripe
- Sensitive card information is never stored by PayPilot
- PaymentIntent creation happens server-side
- Environment variables are excluded from source control
- Webhook events are verified before processing

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for the backend:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_test_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret

PORT=5000
```

Create a frontend `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_test_publishable_key
```

> Never commit `.env` files or Stripe secret keys to Git.
